# Timer Get Up and Start Walking in Odin
A simple timer to make rise from my computer chair more often!

## Description
This is a simple program to make me get up from my computer chair more often. It could be made with a simple entry into cron, but that would not be so fun. Other then that I'm trying out CLion in Odin with the fantastic Odin Intellij plugin so I needed to make some code.

## Note
To run this in Linux you have to install the aplay wav player.

## Commands
```
Valid commands are:
    'quit'
    'start'
    'stop'
    'interval=30' in minutes
    'swap_wav'
```

## Have fun
Best regards, <br>
